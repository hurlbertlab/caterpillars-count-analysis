Notes on Tracie's thesis plots

April 6, 2017

Figures are numbered based on the placement of that plot in my thesis paper. 

Numbers start over with each new section (Methods 1, Methods 2, Results 1, Results 2),
so are not consecutive like in thesis paper.

Relevant scripts needed to create plots:
phenology_thesisplots.R - Results 1, Results 2
compilation_thesis.R - 
presentation_plots.R - All figures starting with "ppt"
