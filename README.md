### Tara: Effect of avian predation on arthropod density across tree species and regions
Many birds rely on arthropods, especially caterpillars, to feed their young during the breeding season. The availability of arthropods as a food resource is important for avian success. Although there are many studies of relationships between particular species of arthropods and their host plants, there are few characterizing the controls on arthropod density as a broad taxonomic group. I tested for top-down control by bird predation and bottom-up control by tree species on arthropod density in two regions, The North Carolina Piedmont and the Southern Appalachian Mountains. To test the top-down effect of birds on arthropod density, I compared densities between tree branches that were or were not exposed to bird predation. There was evidence of avian suppression of density for both arthropod orders commonly eaten by birds and for caterpillars in the Piedmont, but not in the Appalachians. I tested whether tree species has a bottom-up effect on arthropod density by calculating average arthropod densities for common tree species in both regions. I found a bottom-up effect of tree species on overall arthropod density, with certain regionally abundant tree species having significantly greater arthropod densities than others. I also compiled caterpillar density data from the literature and used this, alongside caterpillar density data presented here, as the dependent variable in variance partitioning analyses assessing the role of region, climate (temperature and precipitation), and tree species in predicting caterpillar density across five regions. Tree species explained more variance than climate. Climate variables included did not explain as much variance as region, suggesting there are additional environmental variables that affect caterpillar density. These findings could help predict where arthropods will be abundant or scarce, and thereby predict the quality of a location as a site for insectivorous birds raising nestlings. 


### Tracie: The effects of temperature and greenup on the timing of arthropod abundance and avian migration
Migratory bird species must coordinate their migration and breeding to coincide with a period of peak resource availability in the location where they raise their young. Recent evidence suggests that migratory birds have been responding to climate change at different rates than their arthropod food sources. This can lead to a phenological mismatch, where the timing of resource availability produced by a lower trophic level does not align with the timing of resource need of a higher trophic level. Migratory bird species are unable to feed their hatchlings, inhibiting reproductive success. We characterized the seasonal variation of foliage arthropods over the summers of 2015 and 2016 at the North Carolina Botanical Garden in Chapel Hill, NC and the Prairie Ridge Ecostation in Raleigh, NC. Timing and magnitude of peaks in occurrence varied with arthropod order, year, and survey method. Caterpillars and orthopterans had peaks of greater intensity than combined orders of arthropods that represent “bird food.” Timing of peaks were then compared to spring greenup and temperature. Later greenup corresponded with later arthropod peak occurrence with one survey method at both sites, but this was not true for the other survey method or for arthropod peak occurrence comparisons to temperature. The arrival of some bird species aligned with temperature, greenup, and arthropod peak occurrence. These findings help to improve the characterization of arthropod phenology in future studies, and they also demonstrate the importance of testing a network of phenological variables when considering how communities are affected by climate change.
